# Kubespray offline file generator scripts


## What's this?

This is offline support scripts for [Kubespray offline environment](https://kubespray.io/#/docs/operations/offline-environment).

This supports:

* Download offline files.
    - Download Yum/Deb repository files for OS packages.
    - Download all container images used by Kubespray.
    - Download PyPI mirror files for Kubespray.
* Support scripts for target node.
    - Install containerd from local file.
    - Start up nginx container as web server to supply Yum/Deb repository and PyPI mirror.
    - Start up docker private registry.
    - Load all container images and push them to the private registry.

## Requirements

- RHEL / AlmaLinux / Rocky Linux : 9
- Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04

Note: RHEL8 support is dropped from Kubespray 2.29.0.

## Download offline files

Note: You must execute this process on same OS of k8s target nodes.

Before download offline files, check and edit configurations in `config.sh`.

The `podman` is automatically installed to pull and save container images.
But you can use `containerd` instead of `podman`.

* To use containerd
    - Run `install-containerd.sh` to install containerd and nerdctl.
    - Edit `config.sh` and change `docker` variable to nerdctl.

Then, download all files:

    $ ./download-all.sh

All artifacts are stored in `./outputs` directory.

This script calls all of following scripts.

* prepare-pkgs.sh
    - Setup python, podman, etc.
* prepare-py.sh
    - Setup python venv, install required python packages.
* get-kubespray.sh
    - Download and extract kubespray, if KUBESPRAY_DIR does not exist.
* pypi-mirror.sh
    - Download PyPI mirror files
* download-kubespray-files.sh
    - Download kubespray offline files (containers, files, etc)
* download-additional-containers.sh
    - Download additional containers.
    - You can add any container image repoTag to imagelists/*.txt.
* create-repo.sh
    - Download RPM or DEB repositories.
* copy-target-scripts.sh
    - Copy scripts for target node.

## Target node support scripts

Copy all contents in `outputs` directory to target node (which runs ansible).
Then run following scripts in `outputs` directory. 

* setup-container.sh
    - Install containerd from local files.
    - Load nginx and registry images to containerd.
* start-nginx.sh
    - Start nginx container.
* setup-offline.sh
    - Setup yum/deb repo config and PyPI mirror config to use local nginx server.
* setup-py.sh
    - Install python3 and venv from local repo.
* start-registry.sh
    - Start docker private registry container.
* load-push-images.sh
    - Load all container images to containerd.
    - Tag and push them to the private registry.
* extract-kubespray.sh
    - Extract kubespray tarball and apply all patches.

You can configure port number of nginx and private registry in config.sh.

## Deploy kubernetes using Kubespray

### Install required packages

Create and activate venv:

    # Example
    $ python3.11 -m venv ~/.venv/3.11
    $ source ~/.venv/3.11/bin/activate
    $ python --version   # check python version

Extract kubespray and apply patches:

    $ ./extract-kubespray.sh
    $ cd kubespray-{version}

Install ansible:

    $ pip install -U pip                # update pip
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install ansible

### Create offline.yml

Copy [offline.yml](./offline.yml) file to your group_vars/all/offline.yml of your inventory directory, and edit it.

You need to change `YOUR_HOST` with your registry/nginx host IP.

Notes:

* `runc_donwload_url` differ from kubespray official document, and must include `runc_version`.
* The insecure registries configurations of containerd was changed from kubespray 2.23.0. You need to set `containerd_registries_mirrors` instead of `containerd_insecure_registries`. 

### Deploy offline repo configurations

Deploy offline repo configurations which use your yum_repo/ubuntu_repo to all target nodes using ansible.

First, copy offline setup playbook to kubespray directory. 

    $ cp -r ${outputs_dir}/playbook ${kubespray_dir}

Then execute `offline-repo.yml` playbook.

    $ cd ${kubespray_dir}
    $ ansible-playbook -i ${your_inventory_file} offline-repo.yml

### Run kubespray

Run kubespray ansible playbook.

    # Example  
    $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml  --become --become-user=root cluster.yml
